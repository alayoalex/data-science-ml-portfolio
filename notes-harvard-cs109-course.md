# Havard CS109 Data Science Course

## Five key facets of an investigation: 

1. `Data wrangling`, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set
2. `Data management` to be able to access big data quickly and reliably
3. `Exploratory data analysis` to generate hypotheses and intuition
4. `Prediction` based on statistical methods such as regression and classification
5. `Communication` of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries

## Some Key Principles

* use many data sources (the plural of anecdote is not data)
* understand how the data were collected (sampling is essential)
* weight the data thoughtfully (not all polls are equally good)
* use statistical models (not just hacking around in Excel)
* understand correlations (e.g., states that trend similarly)
* think like a Bayesian, check like a frequentist (reconciliation)
* have good communication skills (What does a 60% probability even mean? How can we visualize, validate, and understand the conclusions?)

## Some Challenges

* massive data (500k users, 20k movies, 100m ratings)
* curse of dimensionality (very high-dimensional problem)
* missing data (99% of data missing; not missing at random)
* extremely complicated set of factors that affect peopleâ€™s ratings of movies (actors, directors, genre)
* need to avoid overfitting (test data vs. training data)
